# OnTheMap

Third Project for the Udacity Nanodegree.

# Overview
This app has a map🗺 that shows information posted by other Udacity students👨🏿‍🎓. The map contains pins that show the location where other students have reported studying. By tapping on the pin📍 users can see a URL for something the student finds interesting. Users can also add their own data by posting a string that can be reverse geocoded to a location, and a URL.
